A classical convex optimization problem is considered. We assume that $f(x)$ is a convex function, but now we do not require smoothness.

An important property of a continuous convex function $f(x)$ is that at any chosen point $x_0$ for all $x \in \text{dom } f$ the inequality holds:
$$
f(x) \geq f(x_0) + \langle g, x - x_0 \rangle
$$

. . .

for some vector $g$, i.e., the tangent to the graph of the function is the *global* estimate from below for the function. 

* If $f(x)$ is differentiable, then $g = \nabla f(x_0)$
* Not all continuous convex functions are differentiable.

. . .

We wouldn't want to lose such a nice property.

## Subgradient and subdifferential

A vector $g$ is called the **subgradient** of a function $f(x): S \to \mathbb{R}$ at a point $x_0$ if $\forall x \in S$:
$$
f(x) \geq f(x_0) + \langle g, x - x_0 \rangle
$$

. . .

The set of all subgradients of a function $f(x)$ at a point $x_0$ is called the **subdifferential** of $f$ at $x_0$ and is denoted by $\partial f(x_0)$.

### Subdifferential of a differentiable function

Let $f : S \to \mathbb{R}$ be a function defined on the set $S$ in a Euclidean space $\mathbb{R}^n$. If $x_0 \in \mathbf{ri }(S)$ and $f$ is differentiable at $x_0$, then either $\partial f(x_0) = \emptyset$ or $\partial f(x_0) = \{\nabla f(x_0)\}$. Moreover, if the function $f$ is convex, the first scenario is impossible.
:::

. . .

**Proof**

1. Assume, that $s \in \partial f(x_0)$ for some $s \in \mathbb{R}^n$ distinct from $\nabla f(x_0)$. Let $v \in  \mathbb{R}^n$ be a unit vector. Because $x_0$ is an interior point of $S$, there exists $\delta > 0$ such that $x_0 + tv \in S$ for all $0 < t < \delta$. By the definition of the subgradient, we have
    $$
    f(x_0 + tv) \geq f(x_0) + t \langle s, v \rangle
    $$
:::

. . .

::: {.column width="50%"}
which implies:
$$
\frac{f(x_0 + tv) - f(x_0)}{t} \geq \langle s, v \rangle
$$
for all $0 < t < \delta$. Taking the limit as $t$ approaches 0 and using the definition of the gradient, we get:
$$
\langle \nabla f(x_0), v \rangle = \lim_{{t \to 0; 0 < t < \delta}} \frac{f(x_0 + tv) - f(x_0)}{t} \geq \langle s, v \rangle
$$

2. From this, $\langle s - \nabla f(x_0), v \rangle \geq 0$. Due to the arbitrariness of $v$, one can set 
    $$
    v = -\frac{s - \nabla f(x_0)}{\| s - \nabla f(x_0) \|},
    $$ 
    leading to $s = \nabla f(x_0)$.
3. Furthermore, if the function $f$ is convex, then according to the differential condition of convexity $f(x) \geq f(x_0) + \langle \nabla f(x_0), x - x_0 \rangle$ for all $x \in S$. But by definition, this means $\nabla f(x_0) \in \partial f(x_0)$.

## Subdifferentiability and convexity

:::{.callout-question}
Is it correct, that if the function is convex, it has a subgradient at any point?
:::

. . .

Convexity follows from subdifferentiability at any point. A natural question to ask is whether the converse is true: is every convex function subdifferentiable? It turns out that, generally speaking, the answer to this question is negative.

Let $f : [0,\infty) \to \mathbb{R}$ be the function defined by $f(x) := -\sqrt{x}$. Then, $\partial f(0) = \emptyset$.

Assume, that $s \in \partial f(0)$ for some $s \in \mathbb{R}$. Then, by definition, we must have $sx \leq -\sqrt{x}$ for all $x \geq 0$. From this, we can deduce $s \leq -\sqrt{1}$ for all $x > 0$. Taking the limit as $x$ approaches $0$ from the right, we get $s \leq -\infty$, which is impossible.

## Connection to convex geometry

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="60%"}

Convex set $S \subseteq \mathbb{R}^n$, consider indicator function $I_S : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}$,

$$
I_S(x) = I\{ x \in S \} = \begin{cases} 
0 & \text{if } x \in S \\
\infty & \text{if } x \notin S 
\end{cases}
$$

For $x \in S$, $\partial I_S(x) = \mathcal{N}_S(x)$, the **normal cone** of $S$ at $x$ is, recall

$$
\mathcal{N}_S(x) = \{ g \in \mathbb{R}^n : g^T x \geq g^T y \text{ for any } y \in S \}
$$

**Why?** By definition of subgradient $g$,

$$
I_S(y) \geq I_S(x) + g^T (y - x) \quad \text{for all } y
$$

- For $y \notin S$, $I_S(y) = \infty$
- For $y \in S$, this means $0 \geq g^T (y - x)$

## Optimality Condition

For any $f$ (convex or not),
$$
f(x^\star) = \min_x f(x) \quad \Longleftrightarrow \quad 0 \in \partial f(x^\star)
$$

That is, $x^\star$ is a minimizer if and only if 0 is a subgradient of $f$ at $x^\star$. This is called the **subgradient optimality condition**.

Why? Easy: $g = 0$ being a subgradient means that for all $y$
$$
f(y) \geq f(x^\star) + 0^T (y - x^\star) = f(x^\star)
$$

Note the implication for a convex and differentiable function $f$, with 
$$
\partial f(x) = \{\nabla f(x)\}
$$

## Derivation of first-order optimality

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Example of the power of subgradients: we can use what we have learned so far to derive the **first-order optimality condition**. Recall

$$
\min_x f(x) \text{ subject to } x \in S
$$

is solved at $x$, for $f$ convex and differentiable, if and only if

$$
\nabla f(x)^T (y - x) \geq 0 \quad \text{for all } y \in S
$$

Intuitively: this says that the gradient increases as we move away from $x$. How to prove it? First, recast the problem as

$$
\min_x f(x) + I_S(x)
$$

Now apply subgradient optimality: 

$$
0 \in \partial (f(x) + I_S(x))
$$

## Derivation of first-order optimality {.noframenumbering}

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

Observe

$$0 \in \partial (f(x) + I_S(x))$$

$$\Leftrightarrow 0 \in \{\nabla f(x)\} + \mathcal{N}_S(x)$$

$$\Leftrightarrow -\nabla f(x) \in \mathcal{N}_S(x)$$

$$\Leftrightarrow -\nabla f(x)^T x \geq -\nabla f(x)^T y \text{ for all } y \in S$$

$$\Leftrightarrow \nabla f(x)^T (y - x) \geq 0 \text{ for all } y \in S$$

as desired.

Note: the condition $0 \in \partial f(x) + \mathcal{N}_S(x)$ is a **fully general condition** for optimality in convex problems. But it's not always easy to work with (KKT conditions, later, are easier).

## Example 1

::: {.callout-example}
Find $\partial f(x)$, if $f(x) = |x - 1| + |x + 1|$
:::

. . .

$$
\partial f_1(x) = \begin{cases} -1,  &x < 1\\ [-1;1], \quad &x = 1 \\ 1,  &x > 1 \end{cases} \qquad \partial f_2(x) = \begin{cases} -1,  &x < -1\\ [-1;1], &x = -1 \\ 1,  &x > -1  \end{cases}
$$

So

$$
\partial f(x) = \begin{cases} -2, &x < -1\\ [-2;0], &x = -1 \\ 0,  &-1 < x < 1 \\ [0;2], &x = 1 \\ 2, &x > 1 \\ \end{cases}
$$

## Example 2

Find $\partial f(x)$ if $f(x) = \left[ \max(0, f_0(x))\right]^q$. Here, $f_0(x)$ is a convex function on an open convex set $S$, and $q \geq 1$.

. . .

According to the composition theorem (the function $\varphi (x) = x^q$ is differentiable) and $g(x) = \max(0, f_0(x))$, we have:
$$\partial f(x) = q(g(x))^{q-1} \partial g(x)$$

By the theorem on the pointwise maximum:

$$
\partial g(x) = \begin{cases} 
\partial f_0(x), & \quad f_0(x) > 0, \\
\{0\}, & \quad f_0(x) < 0, \\
\{a \mid a = \lambda a', \; 0 \le \lambda \le 1, \; a' \in \partial f_0(x)\}, & \quad f_0(x) = 0 
\end{cases}
$$

## Example 3. Subdifferential of the Norm


Let $V$ be a finite-dimensional Euclidean space, and $x_0 \in V$. Let $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ be an arbitrary norm in $V$ (not necessarily induced by the scalar product), and let $\lVert \cdot \rVert_*$ be the corresponding conjugate norm. Then,

$$
\partial \lVert \cdot \rVert (x_0) = 
\begin{cases}
B_{\lVert \cdot \rVert_*}(0, 1), & \text{if } x_0 = 0, \\
\{s \in V : \lVert s \rVert_* \leq 1; \langle s, x_0 \rangle = \lVert x_0 \rVert \} = \{s \in V : \lVert s \rVert_* = 1; \langle s, x_0 \rangle = \lVert x_0 \rVert \}, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Where $B_{\lVert \cdot \rVert_*}(0,1)$ is the closed unit ball centered at zero with respect to the conjugate norm. In other words, a vector $s \in V$ with $\lVert s \rVert_* = 1$ is a subgradient of the norm $\lVert \cdot \rVert$ at point $x_0 \neq 0$ if and only if the Hölder's inequality $\langle s, x_0 \rangle \leq \lVert x_0 \rVert$ becomes an equality.

. . .

:::: {.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}
Let $s \in V$. By definition, $s \in \partial \lVert \cdot \rVert (x_0)$ if and only if

$$
\langle s, x \rangle - \lVert x \rVert \leq \langle s, x_0 \rangle - \lVert x_0 \rVert, \text{ for all } x \in V,
$$

or equivalently,

$$
\sup_{x \in V} \{\langle s, x \rangle - \lVert x \rVert\} \leq \langle s, x_0 \rangle - \lVert x_0 \rVert.
$$

By the definition of the supremum, the latter is equivalent to

$$
\sup_{x \in V} \{\langle s, x \rangle - \lVert x \rVert\} = \langle s, x_0 \rangle - \lVert x_0 \rVert.
$$

:::

. . .

::: {.column width="50%"}

It is important to note that the expression on the left side is the supremum from the definition of the Fenchel conjugate function for the norm, which is known to be

$$
\sup_{x \in V} \{\langle s, x \rangle - \lVert x \rVert\} = 
\begin{cases}
0, & \text{if } \lVert s \rVert_* \leq 1, \\
+\infty, & \text{otherwise.}
\end{cases}
$$

Thus, equation is equivalent to $\lVert s \rVert_* \leq 1$ and $\langle s, x_0 \rangle = \lVert x_0 \rVert$.
:::
::::

## Example 3. Subdifferential of the Norm {.noframenumbered}

Consequently, it remains to note that for $x_0 \neq 0$, the inequality $\lVert s \rVert_* \leq 1$ must become an equality since, when $\lVert s \rVert_* < 1$, Hölder's inequality implies $\langle s, x_0 \rangle \leq \lVert s \rVert_* \lVert x_0 \rVert < \lVert x_0 \rVert$.

The conjugate norm in Example above does not appear by chance. It turns out that, in a completely similar manner for an arbitrary function $f$ (not just for the norm), its subdifferential can be described in terms of the dual object — the Fenchel conjugate function.

A set $S$ is usually called a **budget set**.

We say that the problem has a solution if the budget set **is not empty**: $x^* \in S$, in which the minimum or the infimum of the given function is achieved. 

. . .

* A point $x^*$ is a **global minimizer** if $f(x^*) \leq f(x)$ for all $x$.
* A point $x^*$ is a **local minimizer** if there exists a neighborhood $N$ of $x^*$ such that $f(x^*) \leq f(x)$ for all $x \in N$.
* A point $x^*$ is a **strict local minimizer** (also called a **strong local minimizer**) if there exists a neighborhood $N$ of $x^*$ such that $f(x^*) < f(x)$ for all $x \in N$ with $x \neq x^*$.
* We call $x^*$ a **stationary point** (or critical) if $\nabla f(x^*) = 0$. Any local minimizer of a differentiable function must be a stationary point.

## Necessary Conditions

:::{.callout-theorem}

## First-Order Necessary Conditions

If $x^*$ is a local minimizer and $f$ is continuously differentiable in an open neighborhood, then 

$$
\nabla f(x^*) = 0
$$

:::

. . .

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="50%"}

**Proof** Suppose for contradiction that $\nabla f(x^*) \neq 0$. Define the vector $p = -\nabla f(x^*)$ and note that 

$$
p^T \nabla f(x^*) = -\| \nabla f(x^*) \|^2 < 0
$$

. . .

Because $\nabla f$ is continuous near $x^*$, there is a scalar $T > 0$ such that

$$
p^T \nabla f(x^* + tp) < 0, \text{ for all } t \in [0,T]
$$

. . .

:::
::: {.column width="50%"}

For any $\bar{t} \in (0, T]$, we have by Taylor’s theorem that

$$
f(x^* + \bar{t}p) = f(x^*) + \bar{t} p^T \nabla f(x^* + tp), \text{ for some } t \in (0,\bar{t})
$$

. . .

Therefore, $f(x^* + \bar{t}p) < f(x^*)$ for all $\bar{t} \in (0, T]$. We have found a direction from $x^*$ along which $f$ decreases, so $x^*$ is not a local minimizer, leading to a contradiction.
:::
::::

## Sufficient Conditions

:::{.callout-theorem}

## Second-Order Sufficient Conditions

Suppose that $\nabla^2 f$ is continuous in an open neighborhood of $x^*$ and that

$$
\nabla f(x^*) = 0 \quad \nabla^2 f(x^*) \succ 0.
$$

Then $x^*$ is a strict local minimizer of $f$.
:::

. . .

**Proof** Because the Hessian is continuous and positive definite at $x^*$, we can choose a radius $r > 0$ such that $\nabla^2 f(x)$ remains positive definite for all $x$ in the open ball $B = \{ z \mid \|z - x^*\| < r \}$. Taking any nonzero vector $p$ with $\|p\| < r$, we have $x^* + p \in B$ and so

. . .

$$ 
f(x^* + p) = f(x^*) + p^T \nabla f(x^*) + \frac{1}{2} p^T \nabla^2 f(z) p
$$

. . .

$$ 
= f(x^*) + \frac{1}{2} p^T \nabla^2 f(z) p
$$

. . .

where $z = x^* + tp$ for some $t \in (0,1)$. Since $z \in B$, we have $p^T \nabla^2 f(z) p > 0$, and therefore $f(x^* + p) > f(x^*)$, giving the result.

## Peano counterexample

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="45%"}

Note, that if $\nabla f(x^*) = 0, \nabla^2 f(x^*) \succeq 0$, i.e. the hessian is positive *semidefinite*, we cannot be sure if $x^*$ is a local minimum.

. . .

$$
f(x,y) = (2x^2 - y)(x^2 - y)
$$

. . .

Although the surface does not have a local minimizer at the origin, its intersection with any vertical plane through the origin (a plane with equation $y=mx$ or $x=0$) is a curve that has a local minimum at the origin. In other words, if a point starts at the origin $(0,0)$ of the plane, and moves away from the origin along any straight line, the value of $(2x^2-y)(x^2 - y)$ will increase at the start of the motion. Nevertheless, $(0,0)$ is not a local minimizer of the function, because moving along a parabola such as $y=\sqrt{2}x^2$  will cause the function value to decrease.

## Convex case
It should be mentioned, that in the **convex** case (i.e., $f(x)$ is convex) necessary condition becomes sufficient. 

. . .

One more important result for the convex unconstrained case sounds as follows. If $f(x): S \to \mathbb{R}$ - convex function defined on the convex set $S$, then:

. . .

* Any local minima is the global one.
* The set of the local minimizers $S^*$ is convex.
* If $f(x)$ - strictly or strongly convex function, then $S^*$ contains only one single point $S^* = \{x^*\}$.

## Optimization with equality constraints

Things are pretty simple and intuitive in unconstrained problems. In this section, we will add one equality constraint, i.e.

. . .

$$
\begin{split}
& f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } & h(x) = 0
\end{split}
$$

. . .

We will try to illustrate an approach to solve this problem through the simple example with $f(x) = x_1 + x_2$ and $h(x) = x_1^2 + x_2^2 - 2$.

\langle  \delta x, - \nabla f(x)\rangle = \langle  \delta x, \nu\nabla h(x)\rangle = 0  
$$

. . .

Then we came to the point of the budget set, moving from which it will not be possible to reduce our function. This is the local minimum in the constrained problem :)

## Lagrangian

So let's define a Lagrange function (just for our convenience):

$$
L(x, \nu) = f(x) + \nu h(x)
$$

. . .

Then if the problem is *regular* (we will define it later) and the point $x^*$ is the local minimum of the problem described above, then there exists $\nu^*$:

. . .

$$
\begin{split}
\uncover<+->{& \text{Necessary conditions}} \\
\uncover<+->{& \nabla_x L(x^*, \nu^*) = 0 \text{ that's written above}}\\
\uncover<+->{& \nabla_\nu L(x^*, \nu^*) = 0 \text{ budget constraint} }\\
\uncover<+->{& \text{Sufficient conditions}}\\
\uncover<+->{& \langle y , \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \nu^*) y \rangle > 0,}\\
\uncover<+->{& \forall y \neq 0 \in \mathbb{R}^n : \nabla h(x^*)^\top y = 0}
\end{split}
$$

We should notice that $L(x^*, \nu^*) = f(x^*)$.

## Equality constrained problem

$$
\tag{ECP}
\begin{split}
& f(x) \to \min\limits_{x \in \mathbb{R}^n} \\
\text{s.t. } & h_i(x) = 0, \; i = 1,\ldots, p
\end{split}
$$

$$
L(x, \nu) = f(x) + \sum\limits_{i=1}^p\nu_i h_i(x) = f(x) + \nu^\top h(x)
$$

Let $f(x)$ and $h_i(x)$ be twice differentiable at the point $x^*$ and continuously differentiable in some neighborhood $x^*$. The local minimum conditions for $x \in \mathbb{R}^n, \nu \in \mathbb{R}^p$ are written as

$$
\begin{split}
& \text{ECP: Necessary conditions} \\
& \nabla_x L(x^*, \nu^*) = 0 \\
& \nabla_\nu L(x^*, \nu^*) = 0 \\
& \text{ECP: Sufficient conditions} \\
& \langle y , \nabla^2_{xx} L(x^*, \nu^*) y \rangle > 0,\\
& \forall y \neq 0 \in \mathbb{R}^n : \nabla h_i(x^*)^\top y = 0
\end{split}
$$

## Linear Least Squares

:::{.callout-example}
Pose the optimization problem and solve them for linear system $Ax = b, A \in \mathbb{R}^{m \times n}$ for three cases (assuming the matrix is full rank):

* $m < n$
* $m = n$
* $m > n$
